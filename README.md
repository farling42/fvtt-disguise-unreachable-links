# Introduction

This very small module performs one simple task: hide links which are not reachable by players.

# Detail

When displaying journal entries or actors to players, if the linked document is not reachable then the special link presentation will be replaced by just the normal text.

Thus players will not realise that there is another document to which they don't have access.

*By accessible, we mean that the player has at least LIMITED permission on that document*
